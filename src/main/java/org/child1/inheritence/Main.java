        //to acquire the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class
        //(called the parent or superclass).It promotes code reuse and establish a
        //relationship between classes. The subclass inherits all accessible members
        //(fields and methods) from the superclass. The subclass can also add its own
        //members or override inherited methods .
        //Inheritance has a 'IS-A' relationship , between patrent and child , as parent is
        //a part of the child(child is a bigger with extra properties) , so Child 'IS-A'
        //parent. So Dog 'IS-A' Animal .
        //(So the parent is created first and the child is created when we write child obj
        //as will be requiring parent's properties). (So parent exists inside of child) .
