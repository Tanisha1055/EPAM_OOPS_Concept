Instance Initializer Blocks

An instance initializer block is a block of code inside a class, not inside any method, and without the
static keyword. It runs every time an object is created, after the instance fields are assigned their
default values, but before the constructor runs.

Order of Execution

Instance fields are set to default values (0, null, etc.).
Instance initializer blocks run, in the order they appear.
Constructor runs.

Why use instance initializer blocks?

To share code between multiple constructors.
To perform setup that should happen before the constructor.

Summary Table

Term	                         What is it?	                When does it run?
Instance field	                 Variable for each object	    When object is created
Instance initializer block	     Code block for each object	    After fields, before constructor

In short:

Instance fields are per-object variables.
Instance initializer blocks are code blocks that run every time an object is created, before the
constructor.
