🔹 Scenario 2 – Aggregation

Question:

A Department has Employees. If department is closed, employees still exist. What relationship?

Answer:

👉 Aggregation

Code:

    String name;
}

class Department {
    List<Employee> employees;

    Department(List<Employee> employees) {
        this.employees = employees;
    }
}
