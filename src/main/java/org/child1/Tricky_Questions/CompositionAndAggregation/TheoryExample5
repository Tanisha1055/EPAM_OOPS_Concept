🔹 Scenario 1 – Association

Question:

A Doctor treats a Patient. Both exist independently. What relationship is this?

Answer:

👉 Association

Because:

Doctor can exist without Patient

Patient can exist without Doctor

Code:

class Doctor {
    void treat(Patient p) {
        System.out.println("Treating patient");
    }
}

class Patient {
    String name;
}

This is association because there is no ownership.”
