🔹 Scenario 3 – Composition

Question:

A Car has an Engine. If car is destroyed, engine is useless. What relationship?

Answer:

👉 Composition

Code:
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // created inside

    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }
}


👉 Interview line:

“This is composition because engine is tightly coupled to car.”
