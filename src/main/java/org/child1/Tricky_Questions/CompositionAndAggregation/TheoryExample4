Q5. Why is composition preferred over inheritance?

Expected answer:

“Because composition provides better flexibility and avoids tight coupling.”

Reasons:
In inheritance, coupling is strong and static:
Child class cannot exist without parent
Any change in parent can break child
You are forced to inherit all behaviors, even ones you may not want
In composition, coupling is weaker and more controlled:
The parent (container) chooses which objects to use
Objects can be swapped, replaced, mocked
You can use interfaces to reduce coupling even more

“Composition does involve coupling because one class uses another, but it provides looser and more
flexible coupling than inheritance. With composition, we can easily swap, extend, or mock dependencies
without affecting the container class, whereas inheritance creates a rigid relationship that is harder
to change.”
