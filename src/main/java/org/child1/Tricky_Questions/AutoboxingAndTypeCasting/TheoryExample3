Upcasting

What is it?
Upcasting means assigning a child class object to a parent class reference.

Syntax:

Parent ref = new Child();
Implicit: No explicit cast needed.

Why is it safe?

Every child object is a parent object (inherits all parent features).
You can always treat a child as its parent, but you only access parent methods/fields.

Example:

class Animal { void eat() {} }
class Dog extends Animal { void bark() {} }

Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting
a.eat(); // Allowed
// a.bark(); // Not allowed, Animal doesn't have bark()

Downcasting

What is it?

Downcasting means assigning a parent class reference (that actually points to a child object) to a
child class reference.

Syntax:

Child ref = (Child) parentRef;

Explicit: You must use a cast.

Why is it risky?

The parent reference must actually point to a child object.
If it doesn’t, you get a ClassCastException at runtime.

Example:

Animal a = new Dog(); // Upcasting
Dog d = (Dog) a;      // Downcasting, safe because 'a' is actually a Dog
d.bark();             // Allowed

Animal a2 = new Animal();
Dog d2 = (Dog) a2;    // Risky! a2 is not a Dog, throws ClassCastException

Syntax	                           Parent ref = new Child();	  Child ref = (Child) parentRef;
Safety	                           Safe	                          Risky (may throw ClassCastException)
Cast Needed	                       No	                          Yes
Usage	                           Access parent features only	  Access child features (if safe)

Key Points:

Upcasting is always safe and is used for generalization (polymorphism).
Downcasting is only safe if the object is actually an instance of the child class; otherwise, it fails
at runtime.
