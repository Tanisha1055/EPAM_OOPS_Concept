Q1. Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation?

Expected points:

Abstraction	                                      Encapsulation
Hides implementation	                       Hides data
Achieved using abstract class/interface	       Achieved using private + getters/setters
Focus: what	                                   Focus: how
